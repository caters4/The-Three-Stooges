This website is about Stevo's Hot Wings. This site probably is not the best based on the fact that I wish we had more time. In addition to that it was hard to get it responsive. Even through all that, my team & I developed a website and we hope you like it.   -Nathaniel Wilson



What I would include in my readme file is how hard the website was, how long the website actually took and how we had to know certain type of computer codes to make sure our website was good and responsive. I would also include how we had to pick different clients to make a website about and how we had to make the website flow better. Overall, the program was fun: we got to choose our own partners, our own clients, and how the website would actually look.   -Caterrius Curry
